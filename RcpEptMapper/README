-- RcpEptMapper elevation of privilege patch

itm4n found a great vulnerability in Windows 7 and 2008 where authenticated (but non-administrator) local users can get SYSTEM rights:

https://itm4n.github.io/windows-registry-rpceptmapper-eop/

This is caused by Users having ability to create subkeys in two Windows services, although RcpEptMapper is really your route to admin.

-- Patch.bat

This script is a fix for RcpEptMapper and Dnscache service permission issue, allowing elevation of privilege on Windows 7 and Server 2008/2008 R2
Make sure you have subinacl.exe (in this repositary) in same location as batch file.  

Example deployment scenario: - drop files in SYSVOL file share, modify subinacl.exe location (e.g. \\domain\sysvol\subinacl.exe),
call from Computer login script in GPO (or psexec \\*)

-- Requirements

This works on any version of Windows 7 and/or Windows Server 2008, including without extended security updates.

-- Disclaimers

SubInAcl.exe is an official Microsoft tool.  This patch is not an official Microsoft tool.
